The goal of the Windows SDK Documentation is to give any developer with iOS or Android experience the knowledge and understanding required to create world changing applications using DJI's technology.

In addition to detailing how to use the Windows SDK, this documentation describes and compares the products it can automate and the key technologies available.

### Get Started Immediately

Developers can [Run the Sample Application](../quick-start/index.html) to immediately run code and see how the DJI Windows SDK can be used. 

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.

### Introduction

Most of DJI's aircraft and handheld cameras can be automated using the DJI Windows SDK. This section introduces and compares these products, and introduces the Windows SDK and it's architecture.

* [Windows SDK Introduction](./windows_sdk_introduction.html)
* [SDK Architectural Overview](./sdk_architectural_overview.html)

### Concepts to Understand

DJI products use technologies that not all developers are familiar with. Understanding the concepts of these technologies will make development easier, and allow developers to fully utilize the capability of DJI's aircraft and handheld cameras.

* [Flight Control](./flightController_concepts.html)
* [Camera Exposure](./camera_concepts.html)

### Guides

Guides contain detailed information on product and SDK components. Most of the technologies and terminology used within the SDK is covered in these guides.

* [Flight Controller](./component-guide-flightController.html)
* [Camera](./component-guide-camera.html)
* [Gimbal](./component-guide-gimbal.html)
* [AirLink](./component-guide-airlink.html)
* [Remote Controller](./component-guide-remotecontroller.html)
* [Smart Battery](./component-guide-battery.html)
* [Missions](./component-guide-missions.html)
* [SDK Manager](./sdk-guide-sdkmanager.html)

### Development Workflow

From registering as a developer, to deploying an application, this section will take developers through the full development process.

* [Prerequisites](../application-development-workflow/workflow-prerequisits.html)
* [Register as a DJI Developer & Download SDK](../application-development-workflow/workflow-register.html)
* [Integrate SDK into Application](../application-development-workflow/workflow-integrate.html)
* [Run Application](../application-development-workflow/workflow-run.html)
* [Testing, Profiling & Debugging](../application-development-workflow/workflow-testing.html)
* [Deploy](../application-development-workflow/workflow-deploy.html)

### Tutorials

Several iOS and Android tutorials are provided as examples on how to use the SDK for different applications.

* [Camera Application](../tutorials/index.html)
